Back then I was living around 20 min from the library. When I got home my stream was still loading so I browsed Facebook on my phone and started to see various memes and initially had no idea what was going on. Apparently in the couple of minutes I was away Lewandowski scored 5 goals. Tbh back then I was a poor student, young, no job or car or money on my bank account but that was one of my happiest moments ever. I think I'll carry this memory with me to the afterlife.

"This will never ever happen again. 5 goals in 9 minutes for a team is almost impossible. For it be scored by just one player after coming on as a sub and his team trailing 1-0 should really be impossible. No player would ever had even dreamed of doing something like this because its so far fetched, its literally impossible. I still dont know how this is possible. 5 goals in 90 mins by a single player is a huge achievement. 5 goals in 9 mins and that 9 mins includes celebrations, a re taken kick off and a substitution. How did he do it, its a miracle of football. And that last goal is just a worldie. This has to be the best 10 minutes any footballer in history has had. Credit to the rest of the Bayern team for creating the oppurtunities and its always a team effort but Lewandowski deserves something for this. Its an achievement that will never be bettered.

Well that's what happened here. Only not with 1 vs 1 player, but with the whole two teams - where one felt like sharks that felt the blood within few km, and also their fans were cheering hard for them, and the second team - even that they are great players, worth millions for each, simply lost it all, felt angry, sad, and broken at all.

I also remembered that Lewandowski had one more chance beside this time. If that chance also succeeded, Not 5 goals in 9 mins, but 6 goals in 10 mins was to be that Lewy's legendary record in history.
