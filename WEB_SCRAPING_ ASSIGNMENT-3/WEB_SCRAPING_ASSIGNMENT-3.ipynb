I still dont know how this is possible. 5 goals in 90 mins by a single player is a huge achievement. 5 goals in 9 mins and that 9 mins includes celebrations, a re taken kick off and a substitution. How did he do it, its a miracle of football. And that last goal is just a worldie. This has to be the best 10 minutes any footballer in history has had.
